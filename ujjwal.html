<h1>Corona Virus</h1>
<body>
<p> 
COVID-19 affects different people in different ways.<br>
Most infected people will develop mild to moderate illness and recover without hospitalization.
<strong>Coronaviruses</strong> are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. <br>
In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.<br>
Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.<br>
In cows and pigs they cause diarrhoea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.
Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.<br>
They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.<br>
The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.<br>
They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.
